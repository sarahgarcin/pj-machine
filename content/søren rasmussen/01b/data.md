text: # Capturing Time and Processing Motion
How do we then intervene in this continuity of algorithmic actualisation? How might the openness and potentiality in human nonsenseous perception and meaning-making processes be enriched by digital archival capture? A starting point is to offer alternative modes of digital thinking from big data analysis in which the actual analysis is not positioned with the digital machine in terms of offering probabilities, but instead offer new possibilities for the data to be reflected upon.  
  
When Etienne Jules Marey operationalized the chronophotographical technique to capture a bird’s flight in a series of overlapping images 150 years ago, he was not only depicting the movement of a bird, he was also mapping the durational change in movement. Marey was in a way picturing time and making the differential duration between the discrete data felt, as the chronophotography is not a tracing of time attempting to account for the bird’s path, but a means to represent and thus make possible an analysis of change in motion. 
   
Though often labeled as a predecessor to cinema, Marey’s work is recognized by Stephen Mamber in its own right in terms of his capture of discrete data as means of analyzing intervals in movement thus being able to measure the forces that determine the movement rather than describing the total movement (2006). Rather than situating Marey’s work within cinema’s chronological continuity, Mamber recognizes the capture of discrete data as “a mode of digital thinking in that, by its very nature, it breaks down a continuous, on-going activity into a set of measurable, discrete components” (2006: 87).  
  
In Mamber’s link between chronophotography and digital thinking he emphasizes data capture as a key concept, since the intent is not to capture data as a realistic reproduction, but rather in a translational quantification “offering up an alternative vision” (ibid.: 89). This alternative vision is the analytic power of the diagrammatic capture of time, enriching perception by bringing the potential in the overseen into attentive recognition.  
  
Marey’s capture and layering of discrete data is a digital thinking in line with what Luciana Parisi defines a ”soft thought” (2013) – an understanding of algorithmic logic that might make alternative visions possible through digital capture and processing. Marey made what could otherwise only be felt nonsensously accessible to human perception by making the determining forces of a bird’s flight visible. The concern, then, is how the complexity of the captured data can be translated from one model (a bird’s flight) to another without reducing its relational potential; how can discrete capture of a bird’s flight offer different spatio-temporal visions and inform future work rather than succumb to axiomatic models?
