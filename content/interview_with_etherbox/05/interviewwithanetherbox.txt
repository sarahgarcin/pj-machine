**Q: Wait a second. If you are changing all the time, what is "constant" in all of this?**  
 A: Constant is the name of an association for art and media based in Brussels. They are often involved in collaborative situations where groups of artists and researchers work over short intense periods of time. Over time Constant, and collectives around it, have experimented with soft- and hardware setups that work over local networks.

**Q: The spatial aspects are one thing, but what about temporality?**  
 A: I am reminded about what Antoinette Rouvroy said last night - I wasn't able to attend myself but an audio recording is now on my server. I think I provide something along the lines of what she describes as a "space of potential".

**Q: Having spent some time with you, do you have a sense of humour?**  
 A: I don't know, really. I am trying not to be ironic. I left it behind me some time before The Cloud. In fact, I have not really used irony since the mid nineties. I find it very hard to deal with the indecidability of Romantic irony: Do you mean this, or that? Irony always makes me weary. So, I tried to learn, but gave up. I feel like I am missing out on something, though. But, you tell me?

**Q: Do you have any questions for us?**  
 A: Don't make me laugh.
