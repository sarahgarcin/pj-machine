text: **Q: Wait a second. If you are changing all the time, what is "constant" in all of this?**  
 A: Constant is the name of an association for art and media based in Brussels. They are often involved in collaborative situations where groups of artists and <span class="change-font">research</span>ers work over short intense periods of time. Over time Constant, and collectives around it, have experimented with soft- and hardware setups that work over local <span class="change-font">network</span>s.

**Q: The spatial aspects are one thing, but what about temporality?**  
 A: I am reminded about what Antoinette Rouvroy said last night - I wasn't able to attend myself but an audio recording is now on my server. I think I provide something along the lines of what she describes as a "space of potential".

**Q: Having spent some time with you, do you have a sense of humour?**  
 A: I don't know, really. I am trying not to be ironic. I left it behind me some time before The Cloud. In fact, I have not really used irony since the mid nineties. I find it very hard to deal with the indecidability of Romantic irony: Do you mean this, or that? Irony always makes me weary. So, I tried to learn, but gave up. I feel like I am missing out on something, though. But, you tell me?

**Q: Do you have any questions for us?**  
 A: Don't make me laugh.
