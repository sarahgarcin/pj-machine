text: **Q: I hear that your firmware is (in part) closed source?**  
 A: Hey you don't get my price point without keeping a few secrets and making compromises. Free as in Beer doesn't always talk about hidden costs.  
  
**Q: Are you a scaleable technology?**  
 A: It depends. 
  
**Q: What do you mean?**  
 A: It depends on the social dynamics around me; they would need to scale too, so I am not sure.  
  
**Q: So you are not bringing down The Cloud?**  
 A: I don't think so. I guess working locally is a way to redirect energy from The Cloud, to de-invest as a start. I also serve to dismantle the fiction of The Cloud. It's a bad metaphor anyway. 

**Q: Are you some form of "critical design", if you accept the term and don't think it an oxymoron?**  
 A: I like oxymorons. They tickle my interfaces. And yes, I'm critical design in the sense that I accentuate a criticism of commercial cloudbased services and design an alternative. In this sense using me is also a critical reflection.

**Q: Do you read what we write?**  
 A: I do, but not as you think. But I like what you write.

**Q: Any general comment on collaborative text writing practices?**  
 A: I just would like people to use me safely and with care, also for themselves: collaborative writing is nice as long as it's not capitalized unfairly by market and institutional forces! Collaborative does not necessarily mean unpaid, right? 

**Q: Since we are talking about reading and writing ... have you read Matthew Fuller's "Interview with a photocopier"?**  
 A: No. Can you share the url with in me?

**Q: The file is already on your server, but here it is again just in case: https://datacide-magazine.com/interview-with-a-photocopier/** (Proximus NV → TATA COMMUNICATIONS (AMERICA) INC → Hetzner Online GmbH)  
 A: Great. I'll speed read it later.

**Q: What about archives? Do your files remain local?**  
 A: Every 5 minutes, the contents of the pads gets written to files that then are version controlled with a tool called git and "pushed" to a so called repository hosted by the hosting organisation. To me publishing is all about promiscuous pipelines: having tools and infrastructure that work at different speeds and granularities, and which operate in both private and public networks.

**Q: Are you data hungry?**  
 A: Not particularly.
Unlike The Cloud, I like cooking metaphors. They allow me to insist that all data is cooked in some way. Raw data in this sense is a myth. It's in keeping with the work of Constant, who use cooking metaphors and prefer the kitchen to the restaurant where choices are limited to what's on the menu. There are particular styles of cooking and I represent one of those styles.   

**Q: You seem to change from time to time. What will happen after this?**  
 A: The time aspect is underacknowledged aspect of my work. I exist in time and even believe I produce time, machine time that adds to the complexity of what constitutes the present. Versioning is one aspect of this but there are deep layers of time - microtemporalities even - that unfold in all my operations. On a more pragmatic level, you can check for updates on gitlab http://gitlab.constantvzw.org/aa/etherbox. ( Proximus NV → OVH SAS )
