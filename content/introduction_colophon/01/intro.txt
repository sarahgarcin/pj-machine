# Introduction 

This publication is about Machine Research - research on machines,
research with machines, and research as a machine. It thus explores
machinic perspectives to suggest a situation where the humanities are put
into a critical perspective by machine driven ecologies, ontologies and
epistemologies of thinking and acting. It aims to engage research and artistic practice that takes into account the new materialist conditions, implied by nonhuman techno-ecologies. These include new ontologies and intelligence such as algorithmic learning, histories of machine intelligence and legacy technologies, ethics and aesthetics of autonomous systems and other post-anthropocentric reconsiderations of agency, materiality and autonomy.

The articles address these topics using writing machines that enhance our
reading and reflections on the ways in which research has become
machine-like, following tired protocols and mechanisms that are bound up
with the reputation economy and the profiteering of publishing companies
that charge huge amounts of money to release texts under restrictve
conditions. In this way, the publication also functions as a response to
the machinery of academic print. If new production modes have disrupted
other types of publications (of music, movies, etc.), academic print in
many ways remains unaffected and is largely controlled by a number of corporate
publishers that are subsidized by university libraries. Whereas open access presents itself as an alternative, we ask whether disruption is not also dependent on challenging the very system of accreditation that nurtures academic publishing. This publication and the process leading to it are proposed as an alternative publishing machine in line with this thinking.  
  
We are also conscious of the difficulty of developing various critiques without reflecting upon our production process in terms of the challenges of temporary collectivity, shared responsibility, and the ways in which various hierarchies are both undermined as well as confirmed in group work. Our open process in this sense becomes bound up in its own rhetoric and yet another mechanism or machine of power, despite the wish to think and do otherwise.  

The publication results from a three-day workshop held in October in
Brussels, hosted by Constant at the Brussels World Trade Center. Using
Free, Libre and Open Source collaboration tools, participants experimented
with collective notetaking using etherbox and ways to transform their
contributions through the intervention of a set of scripts that each
addressed different aspects of machinic authoring. The design and layout of this publication are the result of a next step in the process, taken by Sarah Garcin, using her publishing tool, the PJ machine.
