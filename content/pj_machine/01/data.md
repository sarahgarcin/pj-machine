text: # The PJ Machine

The Machine Research Publication has been made entirely with the PJ Machine, a live publishing tool. In analogy to Dj’ing and VJ’ing, PJ’ing is a way to make publications on the fly. The machine with the colored arcade buttons is connected to folders full of texts and images. By hitting the buttons, you compose your own page.
