#README

This is a script that estimates the similarity between documents that are taken two by two from a larger collection. The algorithm calculates the average frequencies of the words used within the collection of all the documents, and compares these values with the local frequencies of the words within each document individually. The deviations / fluctuations become then the parameters used to calculate a quantitative value of semantic proximity.
