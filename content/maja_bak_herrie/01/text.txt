# Elusive Borders
## Maja Bak Herrie

Whether portrayed as borders, boundaries, or frontiers, it is often by reference to political geography that borders are conceptualized (Basaran). In a legal understanding, borders are in constant transformation, negotiation, and contestation as they are settled by enforcement rather than geographic stability. When compared to a mathematical definition of space given as a geographic boundary between two entities, e.g. the Euclidean or Newtonian definition, a distinct quality of the border is made visible: One can be at the doorstep of Europe, metrically only a few meters from touching the soil of a European country. Yet the political border forms an even more fundamental spatiality, which is possibility. In Euclidean space, two locations might be proximal to one another, but because of the presence of fences and borders, it can be difficult to reach a particular location.

Approaching this paradoxical relationship between the different meanings of borders, I propose the notion of gravity as Levi Bryant uses it. Through an analogy to Einstein’s theory of relativity, Bryant suggests the notion of gravity to denote how semiotic and material entities influence the becoming and movement of subjects and collectives in time and space (Bryant 10). I use these thoughts to delve into the borders of the digital, as I will investigate the shared space between physical and digital borders. The objects of the analysis are two artworks that in two very different ways approach the physicality of borders.


**Constituting a space-time of the information flow**

Nina Canell’s subterranean cable project is the first example of an artistic practice investigating the physicality of digital borders. Included in this project is the series *Mid-Sentence* and *Shedding Sheaths*, both from 2015. Canell’s practice takes its basis in subterranean cables of different sorts: Fiber-optic cables used for long distance telecommunication or for providing high-speed data connection between different locations, electricity and communication cables, as well as a variety of sheathings, designed for applications, e.g. in power lines. The works allow the viewer to perceive normally imperceptible dimensions of reality, as the aesthetic disruption exposes the hidden media of energy flows. 

In continuation of the subterranean cables series, Canell has transformed her website into a route tracker exposing the network information and length of cables used for transmitting her website data. Following Bryant, one could regard the cables as path systems enabling or excluding flows of data or electricity to transfer from one part of the world to another. Loading the website, one becomes aware of these paths as the cables involved in the transmission of the data are uncovered. Without the complicated network of cobber and plastic sheathings, there would be no flow of information, or as Levi Bryant puts it, space-time does not pre-exist things, but rather arises from things (Bryant 12).
