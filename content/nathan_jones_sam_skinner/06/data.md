Liminal
Type
The
typeface
(pictured)
Skinner
designed
for
a
speed
reader
accentuates
areas
where
contours
intersect.
It
engages
with
the
notion
of
text's
evaporation.
Perhaps
its
relative
lack
of
materiality
compared
to
these
letters
here,
might
make
it
easier
to
absorb
</pre>
<pre>
or
for
it
to
absorb
us.
The
liminal
typeface
is
both
easier
and
more
difficult
to
read.
It
is
influenced
by
the
work
of
Mark
Changizi
which
describes
how
all
human
visual
signs,
from
letters
to
houses,
icons
and
logos
to
maps
and
dry
stone
walls,
possess
a
similar
signature
in
their
configuration
distribution.
This
suggests
there
are
underlying
principles
governing
their
shapes.
He
provides
an
ecological
hypothesis :
that
visual
signs
have
been
culturally
selected
to
match
the
kinds
of
conglomeration
of
contours
found
in
natural
scenes.
Perhaps
because
that
is
what
we
have
evolved
to
be
good
at
visually
processing
</pre>
<pre>
skills
developed
for
orientating
ourselves
through
landscapes
or
divining
fruitful
trees,
for
example.
