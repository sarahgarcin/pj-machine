Do
the
surprising
conceptions
of
legibility
and
readability
within
speed
reading
and
liminal
type
afford
new
possibilities
for
content,
typography
and
the
physical-cognitive
relation
in
reading?
Where
do
the
lower
limits
of
legibility
lie,
the
need
for
speed?
The
withering
of
graphical
marks?
Or
vice
versa,
the
slowness
of
horizontal
reading,
the
heaviness
of
type?
In
a
sense
are
we,
with
the
horizontal
page,
already
at
the
furthest
degree
of
“unnatural”
reading?
Are
our
abilities
to
absorb
information
from
conglomerations
of
lines
already
suppressed
into
their
most
contorted
form,
waiting
to
spring
back
to
archaic,
unfocussed,
fundamental
efficiencies?
What
do
machinic
systems
of
computation
and
display
enable,
awake,
replace,
or
stupefy,
and
how
in
turn
does
this
affect
our
reading
of
and
with
the
world?
