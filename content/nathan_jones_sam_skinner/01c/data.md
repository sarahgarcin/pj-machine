These
physical
components
of
reading
might
be
considered
wasteful,
and
furthermore
present
a
number
of
obstacles
to
*pure*
reading.
For
example,
many
reading
disorders
are
associated
with
a
failure
to
perform
efficient
eye-saccades,
rather
than
any
issue
with
character
recognition
or
interpretation.
This
poses
the
question :
Although
the
modern
brain
has
been
trained
into
a
concentration
of
singular
focus,
do
the
eyes
themselves
retain
an
integral
archaic
distraction?
Speed
reading
apps
like
Spritz
and
Spreader
describe
the
process
of
scanning
back
and
forth
across
a
page
itself
as
"disorderly"
or
"unnatural".
