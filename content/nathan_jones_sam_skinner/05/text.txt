There
seems
to
be
an
urge
to
politicize
these
questions,
this
new
medium.
Are
speed
readers
a
symptom
of
semiocapitalism,
for
example?
Perhaps
only
if
you
read
too
fast,
or
do
not
use
your
new-found
spare
time
to
sufficiently
free
your
mind?
Perhaps
also
they
are
a
cure
for
a
disorder
invoked
by
semiocapital
machinations?
A
cthonic
pharmakon?
We
would
like
to
form
a
theory
and
practice
with
speed
readers
that
is
resistant
to
narratives
of
continual
accelerations
and
efficiency,
even
as
they
appear
to
be
a
metonym
for
this
very
trajectory
in
the
contemporary
environment.
