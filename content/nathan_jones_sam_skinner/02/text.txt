So
increased
speed
of
reading
is
only
one
of
the
possibilities
afforded
by
RSVP.
Commercial
apps
like
Spritz
and
others
like
it,
appropriate
and
redirect
the
science
of
optimal
viewing
position
toward
fluent,
fluid,
immaterial
experience
of
text,
claiming
to
smooth
over
disorders.
Spritz
declares
on
its
website
that :
“You’ll
find
that
you
will
be
able
to
inhale
content
when
you
regain
the
efficiencies
associated
with
not
moving
your
eyes
to
read.
And
you
will
no
longer
move
your
eyes
in
unnatural
ways.”
A
new
natural
then.
As
Colin
Schultz
writes
on
the
smithsonian.com
blog,
"the
process
feels
less
like
reading
and
more
like
absorbing
the
text."
