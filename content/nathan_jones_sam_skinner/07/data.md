The
neuronal
recycling
hypothesis
developed
by
Stanislas
Dehaene,
similarly
implies
that
our
brain
architecture
constrains
the
way
we
read
with
reference
to
more
"natural"
or
fundamental
encounters
with
shapes.
Dehaene
argues
that
our
cortex
did
not
specifically
evolve
for
writing,
rather,
writing
evolved
to
fit
the
cortex
and
to
be
easily
learnable
by
the
brain.
A
massive
selection
process,
where
over
time,
calligraphers,
writers,
designers
developed
evermore
efficient
notations
that
fitted
the
organization
of
our
brains.
