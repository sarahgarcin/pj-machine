Speed
(reading),
incidentally,
can
be
slow
and
fast.
Speed
merely
refers
to
a
replacement
of
the
spacial
dimension
with
a
temporal
one.
As
with
the
difference
between
the
billboard
and
the
receipt,
speed
arrives
with
a
huge
amount
of
latitude.
Stationary
and
blurred
words
mark
the
extremes
of
this
dimension.
As
well
as
raising
interesting
conceptual
questions,
the
speed
reader
asks
new
things
of
our
bodies
and
minds.
It
can
push
against
and
cut
across
our
physical
and
cognitive
capabilities,
amplifying
some
physical
responses,
such
as
blink
reflexes
and
iris
contractions,
over
others,
such
as
subvocalisations.
The
same
can
be
said
of
the
cognitive.
How
does
rhythm,
frequency,
enter
into
the
semiotic
regime
now?
What
is
reading-watching?
Is
this
text
happening
to
us,
rather
than
us
happening
to
it?
