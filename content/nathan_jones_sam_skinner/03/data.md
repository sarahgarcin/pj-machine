text: <pre>
Within
the
format
of
this
publication
we
cannot
show
you
speed
reading,
and
the
text
here
is
far
from
its
vaporous
form.
Perhaps
it
is
boiling
though.
If
it
were
a
flick
book
with
one
word
on
each
page
then
perhaps
it
might
evaporate.
Instead,
here
every
space
is
replaced
by
a
carriage
return.
But
it’s
an
evocative
approximation.
Right?
No?
You’re
reading
down,
down,
down,
dropping,
guided
by
the
plumb
line
of
structural
rules
governing
the
composition
of
clauses,
phrases,
and
words
in
natural
language
(though
you
could
read
in
other
directions,
along
other
lines.)
With
RSVP,
you
go
down
into
the
temporal
depth
of
the
screen.
And
a
repetition

deeper
deeper
deeper

would
simply
be
a
pause
in
the
action
of
transformation
from
one
word
to
the
next.
Deeper
remaining
there
for
three
frames,
as
the
heart
beat
of
the
text
stops.
