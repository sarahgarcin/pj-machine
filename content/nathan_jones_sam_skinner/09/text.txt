We
finish
this
project
precipice
with
questions
If
this
is
(more
than
ever)
a
post-human
time,
and
literature
is
co-evolving
with
and
folding
into
technics,
is
there
a
hard-fork
literature,
a
hard
fork
humanity
at
the
point
of
speed
readers?
One
perhaps
that
somehow
replicates
the
temporal
aspects
of
language
orality,
through
the
shifting
visual
field
of
landscape?
Is
the
speed
reader
the
glitch
at
which
we
dissolve
back
into
landscape
as
reading-beings?
Or
can
speed
reading
be
used
in
such
a
way
that
it
accentuates
the
fundamentally
humane,
suffering,
subvocal
and
involved
physiology
of
reading?
Can
underexplored
potencies
in
temporal
text
be
deployed
to
re-engage
the
throat,
the
eye,
the
hand,
the
empathic
connective
tissue-echo
between
reader
and
writer?
