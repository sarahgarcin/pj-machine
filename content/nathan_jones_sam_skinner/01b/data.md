Speed
reading
applications
isolate
words
from
bodies
of
text,
and
display
them
sequentially,
one
after
the
other,
often
with
the
middle
letter
highlighted
to
retain
the
focus
of
the
eye
in
this
specific
area.
Rapid
Serial
Visual
Presentation
(RSVP)
of
this
order
can
increase
reading
speed
from
100
to
1000
words
per
minute.
It
does
this
in
part
by
suppressing
the
need
for
the
visual
system
to
perform
eye-saccades.
In
*normal*
reading,
when
reading
a
word
among
many
others
your
eye
is
scanning
ahead
for
words
within
your
parafoveal
vision,
and
back
again.
This
saccadic
twitching
of
the
eye
is
echoed
by
the
subvocal
twitching
of
the
throat.
