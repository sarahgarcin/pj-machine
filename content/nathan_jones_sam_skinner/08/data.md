So
words
look
the
way
they
do
because
of
nature
–
traversing
and
born
between
external
landscapes
and
internal
networks.
This
is
a
reading
of
the
brain
itself
as
a
renewable
materialism,
which
we
find
deeply
enticing,
particularly
in
relation
to
the
notion
of
textual
evolution
embodied
and
vaporised
in
speed
reading.
Reducing
conglomeration
to
its
fundamental
core,
the
Torque
liminal
typeface
accentuates
only
the
areas
where
lines
intersect.
It
is
part
of
a
tradition
of
typefaces
in
which
the
marks
are
reduced
to
their
bare-life,
least-lines,
finest,
lightest
form.
Hanging
in
the
balance
between
non
consciousness
and
consciousness,
the
liminality
of
the
type
evokes
a
forest
at
night,
just
as
the
speed
reader
interface
can
invoke
vertigo,
nightmares
or
panic.
