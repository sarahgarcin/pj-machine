text: # testing texting South: <br> a political fiction
## Jara Rocha

### Terms and Conditions 
The term “South” brings a not-only geographically located nor a strictly territorial problematic: it invokes an ontological, constitutive and transversal construct, *a structural management of life*. Better said: South is *infrastructural*, if we consider any *apparatus* to be infrastructural once it affects semiotic-material flows at a certain scale and under a certain regime of standardisation.  

Below, I will expose a selection of experiences that aim at identifying and unfolding simultaneous, intersectional enunciations, notations and dispossessions (Butler and Athanasiou) in relation to the specific apparatus of “South”. This opens up a plan for close-reading the management of flows to hopefully better understand the particular semiotic-material circuit which renders the so-called South and the lives and subjectivities that emerge and co-compose around it. With Penny Harvey and Hannah Knox in “The Enchantments of Infrastructure” I argue that through, with, within, along South there is a need to affirm and highlight the affective force inscribed in infrastructures, as it might hold “the promise of transformation”, “invigorated by mundane engagements with unruly forces that threaten to subvert the best laid plans of politicians and engineers”.  

Politics magnetizes around the conditions of possibilities. A politics of the possible implies to understand that its very key objective is the transformation of desire by accessible means. Fictional works are powerful techniques to widen desire in the shape of “the possible”. Fictions jump over the given - “the probable” – as imaginations that are expanded, projected, constructed, diffracted and cared-about. Often they function as proposals, other times as ready-to-go scripts and usually as hands-on instructables. They offer worldviews that might operate as blueprints for the immediate. And they can be quite affordable, too. Taking and applying fiction for affecting the conditions of possibility as a plan risks to be understood as a mere “goodist” proposal, almost naïve or only tactical. Quite differently, political fictions are at the fundament of the shared world we build on a daily basis. The Modern Project is one of the most evident and sophisticated fictions: operating collectively, unfolding along all its variations of techno-scientific and socio-cultural components. Political fictions have a leading role at the composition and adaptation of the possible in terms of their all-scale, all-durabilities, all-tangibility gradients of materiality, subjectivities and collectivities.  
  
Thanks to meticulous descriptions like those of Paul B. Preciado, I understand that political fictions can definitely be alive. They tend to be alive. A political fiction that is operative is embodied, not alone, and it might exist in transition, in circulation: ready to be read and rendered. Here follow some found-alive political fictions that are at work -in their variety- as regimes of constitution, composition and production of the present presences:
*Somatopolitical* fictions. Related to the flesh and its structuration along dichotomic organisations of health/pathology. E.g.: *Anarchagland* (https://anarchagland.hotglue.me/?decolonizar (Proximus NV → NTT America, Inc. → LeaseWeb Network B.V. → Greenhost BV)).
*Glottopolitical* fictions. Related to the tongue and its modulations through grammar, syntax and diction -often articulated and regulated institutionally. E.g.: political-historical studies of Spanish made by José del Valle (https://seminarioeuraca.wordpress.com/programa72/ (Proximus NV → RIPE Network Coordination Centre → Telia Company AB → Automattic, Inc)).
Geopolitical fictions. Related to the modern regime based on the nation-state and the cientificist Greenwich imposition to order the world and define, modulate and sustain its transnational power relations as well. E.g.: the PIGS designation disseminated by The Financial Times in 2008 to refer to non-flying indebted territories (PIGS in muck).
*Oikopolitical* fictions. Related to the productivist excesses on the neoliberal conditioning of life and internationally sexualized and racialized divisions of labor. E.g.: The care strikes described by Preciarias a la deriva (http://eipcp.net/transversal/0704/precarias2/es (Proximus NV → Cogent Communications → Host Europe GmbH)).
*As far as I remember*, I have read and heard of the notion of political fiction in the South a number of times. But I have never known of approaches to the notion of South itself as a political fiction. If South is the infrastructural apparatus and fiction is the technique to operate and co-compose along it, I detect the *urgency* of experimenting South as a political fiction. An experimental urgency for which *remembering* might not be enough, and which might be not that *far*, neither: Intra-South fictions can and must be practiced presently, closely, accessively. We can afford that.
