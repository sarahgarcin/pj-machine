text: Thanks to meticulous descriptions like those of Paul B. Preciado, I understand that political fictions can definitely be alive. They tend to be alive. A political fiction that is operative is embodied, not alone, and it might exist in transition, in circulation: ready to be read and rendered. Here follow some found-alive political fictions that are at work -in their variety- as regimes of constitution, composition and production of the present presences:
*Somatopolitical* fictions. Related to the flesh and its structuration along dichotomic organisations of health/pathology. E.g.: *Anarchagland* (https://anarchagland.hotglue.me/?decolonizar).
*Glottopolitical* fictions. Related to the tongue and its modulations through grammar, syntax and diction -often articulated and regulated institutionally. E.g.: political-historical studies of Spanish made by José del Valle (https://seminarioeuraca.wordpress.com/programa72/).
Geopolitical fictions. Related to the modern regime based on the nation-state and the cientificist Greenwich imposition to order the world and define, modulate and sustain its transnational power relations as well. E.g.: the PIGS designation disseminated by The Financial Times in 2008 to refer to non-flying indebted territories (PIGS in muck).
*Oikopolitical* fictions. Related to the productivist excesses on the neoliberal conditioning of life and internationally sexualized and racialized divisions of labor. E.g.: The care strikes described by Preciarias a la deriva (http://eipcp.net/transversal/0704/precarias2/es).
*As far as I remember*, I have read and heard of the notion of political fiction in the South a number of times. But I have never known of approaches to the notion of South itself as a political fiction. If South is the infrastructural apparatus and fiction is the technique to operate and co-compose along it, I detect the *urgency* of experimenting South as a political fiction. An experimental urgency for which *remembering* might not be enough, and which might be not that *far*, neither: Intra-South fictions can and must be practiced presently, closely, accessively. We can afford that.  

This is why I propose to keep experimenting with the cheapest, the most affordable technology: language! Where is the fiction of South inscribed, noted, noticed?
