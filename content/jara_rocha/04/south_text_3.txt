### Language as cheap tech
As a technology for shaping the present where speech, deed, writing and reading would be technical uses of it, language is a way of sharing presences through new embodiments. Of letting go of the self and working on a common ground: it is a way of making world. *Somantically*, infrastructurally. 
Language is cheap in the microeconomical sense: affordable and hence ready for placing *radical micropolitics* into practice; but also cheap as in *promiscuous*: dispossessed from the technocolonial scale of values, so contextually demanding.  

The above exemplified listed regimes of presence never apply individually, but in complex compositions, *entangled*. In search of ”mundane engagements with unruly forces”, I wonder about the intersectional and transversal practice that could turn political fictions in a fruitful *repository of possibles*: What fictionalizations of the South could render other infrastructural compositions for the transitional, dispossessed and non-anthropocentric entities that undoubtfully could emerge from them? How can the relationship between language and subject be scaled up to one between language and world-making, problematising the celebratory anthropocentrism of language in a non-identitarist but situated opaqueness?  

Testing and texting of South as a political fiction implies affecting, attending, processing, writing, reading, saying, assembling and directly operating its places of enunciation and its modes of existence and survival. This can be taken as an invitation to a collective *languaging* experiment for which declarations, questions, code, assertions, calls, certificates, manifestos, applications, invoices, memories, formularies, constitutions, exams and testimonies might be apprehended as raw material for wild machinic combinations and/or unsuspected renders. Grasping the opacities and complexities of present linguistic ecologies and their text logistics along the here-now ontological transitionings towards the non-identitary enunciations of the *people to come*. From the very South, with love.
