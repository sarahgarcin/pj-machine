# The PJ Machine

The Machine Research Publication has been made entirely with the PJ Machine, a live publishing tool. In analogy to Dj’ing and VJ’ing, PJ’ing is a way to make publications on the fly. The machine with the colored arcade buttons is connected to folders full of texts and images. <br> By hitting the buttons, you compose your own page.
