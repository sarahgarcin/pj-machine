This double performance of soil, commodifying the earth's resources and emitting visual information, makes it tempting to extend the notion of a -digital- screen to encompass an envelope such as the uppermost crust of the planet. These notes are therefore an attempt to genealogically address the screen in medianatural terms, a genealogy sketched also as an "unmaking". In its broadest sense, it is a methodology that aims to explicitly introduce the processes of making media into the fields of forces and tensions characteristic of the non-binary worlds of medianatures. In this sense, unmaking entails the question of how the very notion of making is destabilized once it is put against a background of inherently interconnected agencies and scales: how it does not make any sense to think that we -alone- are able to make anything, but replicate, refine, rescale processes that are producing us together with our expanded affordances, already.  
  
What this specific unmaking in practical terms is about remains an open question. The interweaving of users and systems, the impossibility of an on-off switch in the context of medianatures, the continuum between signals and data, the blurred thresholds between function and dysfunction, operation and waste or the erosion of scale differences are some of the faded binary relations to work within the context of an unmaking methodology. They are however only initial approximations, based on this agricultural genealogy of the digital.
