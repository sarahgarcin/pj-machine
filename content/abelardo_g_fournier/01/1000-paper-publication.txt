#Unmaking screens. A genealogy of the mineral vision*
##Abelardo Gil-Fournier

During three decades, from 1939 to 1973, the Spanish National Institute of Colonization repurposed enormous extensions of territory linked to the engineering of large-scale water infrastructures. As a consequence of this agrarian reform and land settlement program of Franco's dictatorship, agriculture in Spain started to be industrialized, thanks to the outcomes of chemical industries and the disposal of cheap human workforce. Significantly, this technification, exploitation and population of land coincided with the first series of aerial orthophotographic pictures mapping the whole Spanish territory. As a result, soil became an engineered surface to hold and transform solar light energy into cereals, fruits and vegetables, while at the same time the reflected sunlight became gradually a source of information stored in photographic plates carried on by aircrafts owned by military and cartographic institutes. 

This mediated transformation of the ground belongs to the broader observation of the earth through media that has occurred along with the expansion of the military and extractive industries of the 19 and 20th centuries, in hand with "the rise of an imperial world view" (Kaplan 2007). "In the colonial imagination", in Eyal Weizman words, "the planet is perceived as a design project" (Prochnik 2015), a project where the infosphere controls the geosphere (Virilio, cited in Bishop 2015), with encodings such as "the gridding of time and space, the proliferation of registers, filing and listing systems, the making and remaking of categories, the identification of populations, and the invention of logistics" (Lury, Parisi, Terranova 2012). A transformation led by operations such as the flattening of land, the layout of transport infrastructures, or the spread of networks (such as cables or irrigation canals), which have inscribed physically in the earth their own infrastructural needs and their lobbying interests, expressing their "power to transform, redefine and hybridize nations, territories and cultures in a most material way", as Lisa Parks has put it in relation to satellital infrastructure (Parks 2009).
