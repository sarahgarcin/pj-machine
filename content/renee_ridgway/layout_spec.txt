Herewith my final version of my 1000 word text (this is a new version, including changes and I added my name), my READ ME, my three experimental ‘translations’: ‘Gentle’ text is also new. ‘The Synonymizer' is also slightly altered and my request is to see if having one sentence to a line is nicer than having a ‘block’ format like in the PDF. I realise that you designed the ‘Gentle’ text and ‘The Synonymizer’ are designed to be ‘blocks’ next to each other. You can decide. The ‘encryption’ text is the same.
Also, I thought my pages in your PDF design looked quite good, first the two ‘crazy’ texts, then the ‘readable’ text with the ‘encryption code’ at the bottom that looks like a ‘key’ ;)
However I am also including two images that you can maybe use in conjunction with the texts. I am not sure where the ‘READ ME’ will be in the newspaper, so it may be redundant.

I also included an image of the ’signals’ which fits the 1000 word text. you may or may not use in your design. Depends on the color choice (if there is a budget) I also included the ‘view source’ of the image if you want to use that for something. I am leaving that up to you.
