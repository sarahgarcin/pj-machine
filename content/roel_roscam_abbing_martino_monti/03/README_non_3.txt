freedom, autonomy, <br> peerage, tiering
-----------------------------------

The entanglement of different networks that the Internet is composed of is based on the fundamental element of the IP protocol, which was designed for autonomous inter-operation and dynamic restructuring of the network without a central management center. While on the first experimental inter-networks any machine on any network could directly address any other machine on any other network, the change of scale and complexity due to the global success of the Internet also meant the practical dismissal of flat hierarchies.
The different networks are currently articulated around the concept of 'Autonomous System', the subnetworks that compose the Internet, managed by one organization or company, and in which all communications follow the same routing table. This means that to reach an Internet resource, all the nodes in an Autonomous System agree on which network one packet has to hop next, to move towards a destination.
The current system admittedly keeps a degree of openness and horizontality. The routing tables are free to access, so that each AS is able to check the other AS's routes and decide which ones are convenient to hop to, to assure efficient flows towards all possible destinations.
This technical cornerstone of the Internet, according to certain ideological readings, should guarantee an inherent freedom and openness of the network. We can genuinely acknowledge the free aspect, as long as it is understood in the sense of capitalist market freedom: horizontal participation in the Internet is open to all parties with the economic means to acquire the necessary infrastructures and sign peering-agreements with neighbouring networks.

Peering-agreements are a good example of the way horizontality and openness are perfectly compatible with inequality and de-facto hegemonies. While the word “peer” suggests an equality of sorts, in practice some peers are more equal than others. In order to “peer”, smaller networks have to pay transit fees to larger networks. This produces a hierarchy which is referred to as the system of “tiered” networks. At the top of the hierarchy are the networks which do not need to pay to interconnect with any other networks because of their size and geographic spread, the so-called “Tier 1” networks. 

Tier 1 networks are interesting entities through which we can understand the legacy of past networks on the ones of today. While there is no definitive list of Tier-1 networks, most listings include the same set of companies. What stands out is that most of these companies are the heirs of the old national telecom monopolies in Europe, or of the AT&T monopoly in the U.S. These firms gained this status due to their previous global activities and their historical role in interconnecting various continents: their status is a legacy of the times when these firms where part of colonial and imperial projects. Another thing that stand out is that there are no non-Western Tier 1 networks.

While probing the network, as one keeps returning to the same large transit networks in order to reach geographically disparate destinations, the “centrality” of Tier-1 providers becomes noticable.
This script is a simple example of the short diversions one can take from the uniformed experience of internetworked telecommunications, to remind ourselves of the material conditions and the power relations that are implicated in each and every use of the Internet.
