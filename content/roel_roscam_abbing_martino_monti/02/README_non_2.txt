traceroute, whois
-----------------

The analysis of the route is performed using two fundamental tools which are commonly used to understand and diagnose computer networks: Traceroute and Whois. 

Traceroute probes the routed path between your local network and a given destination and returns a list of points that constitute that path. This is shown by listing the Internet Protocol address of each router on the way. While this information might seem authoritative it is also contingent on what each specific network allows to be measured and might thus be incomplete.

Whois is a tool to look up ownership information about an Internet resource, as a domain name, an IP address or an Autonomous System. In order to register and use such a resource,  a private individual, company or organization has to provide contact details to publicly accessible databases.

Whereas traceroute obtains the logical adress of each node that forms our abstract path through the network, whois turns this information into a story of a network of networks, with different owners, material conditions and legacies. 
Using the two in conjunction reminds one of the aspects of ownership, power and control that come with the participation on a network that is usually perceived as open and horizontal.
At the same time this simple move offers a ground to talk about network politics at an approachable scale, by looking at a specific moment, location, set of agents and operations.
