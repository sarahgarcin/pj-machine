## Notes 
[1] Since 2013, Google.com is the most visited website in the world, according to Alexa. “Google processes over 40,000 search queries every second which translates to over 3.5 billion searches per day and 1.2 trillion searches per year worldwide.” In 1999, it took Google one month to crawl and build an index of about 50 million pages. In 2012, the same task was accomplished in less than one minute. 16% to 20% of queries that get asked every day have never been asked before. Every query has to travel on average 1,500 miles to a data centre and back to return the answer to the user. A single Google query uses 1,000 computers in 0.2 seconds to retrieve an answer. http://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/.

Other sites may want to remove links gained from participating in bad link networks or for other reasons.” http://searchengineland.com/google-penguin-doesnt-penalize-bad-links-259981 (Proximus NV → Tinet Spa → EGIHosting)

[7] Knowledge Graph was launched in 2012 and combines ‘semantic search’ information added to search results so that users do not query further. However this has lead to a decrease of page views on Wikipedia of different languages. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph> (Proximus NV → RIPE Network Coordination Centre → Telia Company AB → Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.)  
[8] In regard to information retrieval, ‘stemming’ is when words are reduced to their ‘stem’ or root form. “Many search engines treat words with the same stem as synonyms as a kind of query expansion, a process called conflation”. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming (Proximus NV → RIPE Network Coordination Centre → Telia Company AB → Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.)
