# From Page Rank to RankBrain
## Renée Ridgway
  
  
The concept of Page Rank has its basis in the Scientific Citation Index (SCI), a form of academic hierarchy that has now been grafted as a conceptual paradigm for the way we find information and how that information is prioritised for us. The eponymous Page Rank algorithm was developed in 1998 and is basically a popularity contest based on votes. A link coming from a node with a high rank has more value than a link coming from a node with low rank. The scheme therefore assigns two scores for each page: its authority, which estimates the value of the content of the page, and its hub value, which estimates the value of its links to other pages.  
  
PR(A) = (1-d) + d (PR(T1)/C(T1) + ... + PR(Tn)/C(Tn))  
  
### Secret recipes

Presently, ‘keyword search’ is still the way Google Search organises the internet by crawling and indexing,1 which determines the importance of a website based on the words it contains, how often other sites link to it, and dozens of other measures. With Google Search the emphasis is to keep the attention of the user and to have them click on the higher rankings, effortlessly. However as Gillespie points out, the exact workings are opaque and vary for diverse users, “the criteria and code of algorithms are generally obscured—but not equally or from everyone” (Gillespie 185). Based on users’ histories, location and search terms, the searcher is ‘personalised’ through a set of criteria.2 Not only are the creators of content of web pages kept in check by search engines, but the tracking of different factors, or signals, determine the ranking of an individual page. Mostly through reverse engineering, a whole ‘Search Engine Optimisation’ (SEO) industry has developed around ‘gaming’ the algorithm to figure out its recipe or signals.
