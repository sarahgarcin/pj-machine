text: If the Frankfurt school of Adorno and Horkheimer focused on the transmission of culture, and cultural studies on its reception (Wark), the more recent work done by Terranova and others turns its attention to the channel. Drawing on the work of Gilbert Simondon, she describes an informational milieu in which meaning is “increasingly inseparable from the wider informational processes that determine the spread of images and words, sounds and affects” (Network Culture 2). How, she asks, “can we still believe that information simply flows from sender to receiver (or from producer to consumer) without any of the noise, indeterminacy, and uncertainty having any effect on the process at all at some level?”   
  <br>
Simondon’s work is not only an influence on Terranova but also on other members of the Autonomist Marxist school of which she is a part. Paulo Virno takes up his notion of the pre-individual in A Grammar of the Multitude (78) while Maurizio Lazzarato explores the individuating and individualising effect of debt. In The Making of the Indebted Man Lazzarato details how debt exploits choice, decision and behaviour in the future (45). In order to do this, the same statistical methods found in information theory are applied to determine probability of an individual’s future actions. Just like communication, a debt relation is subjectivising, occurring between pre-individuals, who become determined by entering into relationships. For Lazzarato finance is a power relation between creditor and debtor (23) has the effect of fixing time and neutralising the political potential of the indeterminate future (70). 

However, as Terranova describes, the statistical estimate is never an exact representation, and although Lazzarato may be right to suggest that debt functions by assuming a continuity of the present with the future, the act of granting credit is not itself a determination of future action. The model of debt that Lazzarato uses, seems far more aligned to broadcast communication and the culture industry, than it does to the networked informational milieu that Terranova adopts from Simondon. While debt can exist as a dialogical relation based in “truth and persuasion” (Terranova, “Communication beyond Meaning” 58) directly between two parties, or as a one-directional power relation of creditor and debtor akin to the sender-receiver relation in broadcast, contemporary finance seems to have far more in common with the noise, indeterminacy, and uncertainty on networked communication. Rather than direct channels of power relations, financialised debt exists in a milieu. Debt can be packaged, securitised, fragmented and resold across the financial system such that creditor-debtor relation, as well as the value of the debt, quickly become disconnected.   

Terranova argues that the more we attempt to measure, the more the essential indeterminacy of the information we receive becomes apparent (“Systems and Networks” 124). The more of ourselves we make available to enter into debt relations – be evaluated as part of our creditworthiness – the more those indeterminacies multiply. Even while it attempts to foreclose the future, the subjectivity produced by finance becomes less, rather than more fixed. For this reason, rather than seeing a restricted and determined subjectivity of indebted man, a cultural politics of debt opens up the possibility for struggle around the definition and limits of alternatives. Across a network of debt, questions of which qualities are evaluated, how indeterminacies are quantified and how risks and responsibilities are distributed become the open and contestable, not just at the points of transmission and reception, creditor and debtor, but at all points within the system.
