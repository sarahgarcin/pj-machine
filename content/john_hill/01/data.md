text: # Don’t just sit there shouting <br> at television, <br> get up and change <br> the channel
## John Hill

In the end of  first episode of John Berger’s 1972 television series Ways of Seeing, he closes with the request that viewers consider what he has shown them – an argument that through reproduction, images have become a form of information – but to “do so sceptically”. He tells the viewer to be wary of one-directional broadcast media, and calls for wider access to television so that the viewer can speak back. In this short monologue can be seen three ideas of what communication is and can be: dialogue, broadcast and network. This essay will discuss these different constructions and go on to ask how debt, and the subjectivities it produces, might be structured in a similar way.

Berger is aware of the power that the broadcast medium gives him, but that power is in part based on how the relationship of sender to receiver is conceived. The mathematical model of communication, developed by Claude Shannon, assumes a receptive audience and one that is already aware of what the possible messages will be. Tizianna Terranova describes how the statistical model of information relies on the exclusion of possibilities beyond what has been pre-agreed and the “reduction of communication to the resolution of such uncertainties through the selection of one of the alternatives from the set” (Network Culture 24). It is this reduction that Theodor Adorno and Max Hokheimer’s critique in their essay The Culture Industry. Contrasting it to the liberal, dialogical, two-way communication of the telephone, they see broadcast as inherently limited and limiting (112). Berger proposes a return to dialogue through wider access television but his understanding of the informational quality of the reproduced image suggests another aspect, or consequence, of mathematical communication that Terranova highlights in her critique. 

Although, if properly encoded with an appropriate redundancy, a message can be accurately decoded by the receiver with a high degree of probability, information theory does not allow the possibility of being absolutely sure. Rather than being a reproduction or representation of the information source, the message received always has a probabilistic relationship to the message sent. It is not impossible to determine with absolute certainty that a signal is decoded to the same message that way originally encoded. Berger’s call for scepticism does not encourages his audience to decode the message, but to interpret the information they receive differently, just as his series invites the viewer to consider not “paintings themselves…but the way we now see them”. These words make evident a shift  from the primacy of transmission to the importance of reception, which Terranova links to the delevopment of cultural studies in the 1980s where, rather than a channel of connectiontion, information is seen as a disconnection between sender and receiver. Terranova notes that the failure of cable television to allow wider access and a return to dialogue meant that “resistance to media power had to be located in the viewer” (“Systems and Networks” 117).
